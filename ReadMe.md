Students will create a program using java swing to demonstrate understanding of 2D Arrays, Merge Sort (recursive), and encapsulation.

There is a lot of freedom to come up with a design that is interesting to you, but the output of your program must demonstrate the use of:

1. A 2D ArrayList

In addition to the game board, which is provided for you in the form of a 2D ArrayList, you will need to create your own 2D Array of Strings that contains the name of the piece and an assigned text value. The structure for this 2D Array should be at least 2x6, for a total of 12 different data points. You can add as many sprites to the board so long as you have sorted the outputs in some way.
You can use data points more than once, for example if you try to re-create a chess board you would have one King, one Queen, two Rooks, two Bishops, two Knights and eight Pawns for each side of the board, a total of 32 sprites.

2. Recursive merge sorting

When you instantiate your 2D Array, organize the images alphabetically based on the name given to your image (the variable name). You must use merge sort to organize your data into the final placement positions using the number values you assigned on the worksheet. 
Use a sorting method to organize your pieces, use the values in column 0 to 'place' your pieces. The above example is not exactly the values you would use for the chess board. For example, if you did chess pieces your pawns would have to be sorted to fall into the second and 7ths rows of your board. You would assign the values to rooks, bishops, and queen based on their placement on an actual board. 
When you are sorting your array by value, make sure you also move the values in all the columns so your data points stay adjacent to each other and don't get scrambled.

3. At least 6 different game pieces must be used, but you must cover at least 32 squares of the board. Be creative about what your images will be when they are sorted. See below for more suggestions:

Chess pieces, game assets
vegetables and farming game assets
bubble pop game assets
retro tiles game assets
Density maps to represent concentrations of data, like storms, infection rates, etc. 
Draw with RGB codes. You must save the RGB value into a string and coordinate the positions of each color instead of images
